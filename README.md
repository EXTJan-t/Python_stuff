implemented a naive plakoto player however extremely slow and doesn't seems to have an advantage over random strategy computer player which is weird

now the flat mc player functions correctly and has in average of 57% of win rate against random strategy player with a simulation time of 5.Turns out that I did not handle correctly the simulation process and thus the player got extra dices leading to uncorrect results.
